# sfg_pet_clinic

The SFG Pet Clinic application. [WIP]

This repository contains an example implementation of the well-known Pet Clinic Application for Spring 5. The original reference implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).

This specific implementation is built based on the [Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru](https://www.udemy.com/testing-spring-boot-beginner-to-guru) online course and serves as a study platform to reinforce different concepts and best practices within the Spring Framework. It does use some of the original static resources such as images, styles, etc.
Because of its use as a study platform, it will be heavily commented. Since I am also new to Java programming, this includes comments about general syntax as well as Spring specific contents.
